# Codecademy Learners Mockup Data Analysis ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Codecademy Learners Data Analysis project! In this project, we'll be analyzing mockup data of Codecademy learners to gain insights into their learning patterns and behaviors.

## Project Goals
Our goals for this project include:

1. Exploring the data using SQL queries and aggregate functions.
2. Identifying insights such as the top 25 schools (.edu domains), the number of .edu learners in New York, and the number of learners using the mobile app.
3. Utilizing the `strftime()` function in SQLite to analyze sign-up counts for each hour.
4. Performing table joins to delve deeper into the data, such as understanding course preferences among different schools and courses taken by learners in specific locations like New York and Chicago.

## Prerequisites:
- Familiarity with SQL queries, aggregate functions, and multiple table joins.
